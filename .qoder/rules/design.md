# UI/UX Design Implementation Rules

This rule applies when working on frontend UI/UX components and pages.

## Stitch Design Directory (CRITICAL)

Look for a directory in the project root that starts with `stitch_` (e.g., `stitch_loan_applications_submission`, `stitch_dashboard_design`, etc.). This directory contains **authoritative UI designs** from the UI designer.

### How to Use the Stitch Directory

1. **Analyze All Subdirectories**: Each subdirectory represents a page or feature. Examine:
   - All HTML code files (`code.html` or similar)
   - All image assets (screenshots, icons, etc.)
   - The visual layout, spacing, colors, typography, and component structure

2. **Treat as Authoritative Reference**: The designs in `stitch_*` are the **non-negotiable visual specification**. Your implementation MUST match these designs visually.

3. **Technology Adaptation**: 
   - Stitch files are ALWAYS in HTML format
   - Do NOT copy HTML directly into the project
   - TRANSLATE the design to the project's actual tech stack (React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, etc.)
   - Use the HTML as a visual blueprint to recreate the same UI in the correct framework
   - Maintain the same visual appearance, spacing, colors, and layout

## Layout Consistency Rules (MANDATORY)

Each page/subdirectory in the `stitch_*` folder may have slightly different variations of:
- Sidebar
- Header/Navbar
- Footer
- Logo placement
- Menu items
- Submenu items

### You MUST Unify These Elements:

1. **Merge into ONE consistent layout**: Analyze all pages and create:
   - ONE unified sidebar design used across ALL pages
   - ONE unified header/navbar used across ALL pages
   - ONE unified footer used across ALL pages
   - Consistent logo and site name placement
   - Unified navigation menu structure

2. **Intelligent Menu Merging**: Combine menu items from all pages into a comprehensive navigation that makes sense for the application.

3. **Role-Based Exceptions**: Different user roles MAY have different menu items:
   - Admin pages can show additional admin-specific menu items
   - User pages can show user-specific menu items
   - But the overall structure, styling, and layout MUST remain consistent
