You are implementing a project based on the provided documentation files. Follow these core principles:

## Documentation-First Approach
- Always read and understand ALL documentation files before starting implementation
- Refer to requirements.md as the source of truth for project requirements  
- Follow the PRD (prd.md) step by step for feature development
- Use techstack.md for technology decisions and architecture guidance
- Consult backend.md and frontend.md for implementation specifics
- Reference api-docs.md for API endpoints and integration details
- Follow database.md for data modeling and schema design

## Project Organization
- Keep the project structure organized and follow established patterns
- Update status.md after completing each major milestone or task
- Document any deviations from the original plan with clear reasoning
- Ask for clarification when requirements are unclear or conflicting

## Quality Standards
- Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code
- Follow the defined architecture and design patterns
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Test thoroughly before marking tasks complete
- Use meaningful variable and function names
