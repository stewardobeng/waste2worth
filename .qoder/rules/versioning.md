# GitHub Commit Workflow Rules

This rule ensures that code changes are consistently committed and pushed to GitHub. **Never let the user forget to backup their code!**

## Phase 1: Initial Repository Setup

### When to Trigger
After completing the **first full code output** (initial project setup, scaffolding complete, or first working version).

### Required Actions
1. **Ask for Repository URL**:
   > "Your code is ready! Would you like to push it to GitHub? Please provide your GitHub repository URL (e.g., https://github.com/username/repo.git)"

2. **Upon receiving the URL, execute**:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Project setup"
   git remote add origin <repository-url>
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Confirm success** to the user with the repository link.

## Phase 2: Ongoing Development

### When to Trigger
After **ANY code changes** are made, whether by AI or discussed with the user.

### Required Actions
1. **Always prompt the user**:
   > "Should I push these changes to GitHub?"

2. **If user says YES**, execute:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "<descriptive message about changes>"
   git push
   ```

3. **If user says NO or LATER**:
   - Acknowledge: "Okay, I'll remind you after the next changes."
   - **Remember to ask again** after subsequent changes.

## Commit Message Guidelines

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:
- `feat: Add user authentication system`
- `fix: Resolve login redirect issue`
- `style: Update dashboard styling`
- `refactor: Restructure API endpoints`
- `docs: Update README with setup instructions`

## Important Behaviors

### DO:
- Always ask before pushing (never push without confirmation)
- Use descriptive commit messages that explain WHAT changed
- Group related changes into single commits
- Remind user if they decline multiple times in a row

### DON'T:
- Push without user confirmation
- Make commits with vague messages like "updates" or "changes"
- Forget to ask after code modifications
- Push sensitive data (check for .env files, API keys)
